# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainer via email listed in `src/_data/metadata.js` (if configured), or through your repository host's private security advisory feature.

## Response

We will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and provide updates during triage and remediation.
