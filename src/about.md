## About Crispwrite

Crispwrite is a lightweight Eleventy starter that helps you launch a personal blog quickly while keeping full control over your content and code.

### What makes it useful

- **Fast setup**: clone, install, and start writing.
- **Open-source friendly**: simple structure, contributor guide, and clean defaults.
- **Production-ready basics**: SEO tags, RSS feed, sitemap, and a custom 404 page.
- **Easy to adapt**: swap colors, fonts, or layouts without rewriting the project.

### Quick customization checklist

1. Update your site info in `src/_data/metadata.js`.
2. Replace sample post content in `src/blog/`.
3. Update author image in `src/assets/images/`.
4. Explore tags at `/tags` and search at `/search`.
5. Edit navigation links in `src/_includes/partials/`.
6. Deploy to Netlify (or any static host).
